Calculate and return the results of an assessment (items attempted, items correct, total marks awarded) based upon the test content and candidate responses. Candidates may respond to all, some or none of the items in their multi-choice assessment.

**multiChoiceItems**: a list of items representing the assessment content.

**responses**: dictionary representing the candidate responses:
		**key**: index into multiChoice item
		**value**: index options for multiChoice item
		
Write maintainable and efficient code.

Unit tests will be run to ensure the validity of your solution. **Some are not visible to you.**

Before moving on, **please make sure to check that the "test results" tab displays 2 passed unit tests**.
